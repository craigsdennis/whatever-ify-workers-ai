# Whatever-ify

Turn yourself into...whatever. Take a photo, get a description, generate a scene and character, then generate an image based on that calendar.

This project is built using [Workers AI](https://ai.cloudflare.com) and [Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). I'm keeping the ðŸ”¥ by using the [Hono](https://honojs.dev) framework.

This app, like all of us, is a work in progress.
